                <h3>How we met</h3>
                <p> I first saw Swathi in the Fall of 2017 when we started our undergrad. I was instantly attracted to
                    her but was far too nervous to speak to her. I had told my friend I liked her and news had traveled
                    fast and she soon found out. Her first reaction was "Who is Hari?" and she began searching for me in
                    the class. She started to take notice of me and no matter how boring the lecture was, we never
                    missed a class after that. After a good few months I finally plucked up the courage to ask her out
                    and the rest is history !!</p>

                    <h5>1p.m.-5p.m.</h5>
                    <p>It's one of the oldest traditional Indian pre wedding ceremony where the bride and groom
                        attend the event together and a professional mehndi artist applies
                        mehndi to the bride's hands and feet. This will be having a celebratory
                        festival feel to it with people wearing vibrant clothes and dancing, singing, playing
                        games and a lot more.</p>

                    <h5>10a.m.-1p.m.</h5>
                    <p>The haldi ceremony is usually held separately for the bride and the groom. This one is for the
                        bride. It is a low-key event that involves the application of turmeric paste on the hands, legs
                        and face of the bride. The groom is not allowed to see the bride after this ritual until the
                        final wedding ceremony starts.</p>

                    <p>This is the main event in the entire wedding when the bride and the groom tie the
                        knot. The groom comes with the barat and is greeted by the bride side with some dhol of course
                        as maximum number of guests would be attending this event. This is when the couple circle the
                        sacred fire and are finally declared husband and wife.</p>
